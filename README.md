•	This is the memory game. To start playing, you must press the START GAME button. 

•	When you do, a 5 second countdown will appear under the grid.

•	After the countdown, all the buttons will turn blank and you will have to click on the ones that had an O in it.

•	If you select more than 2 X’s, you run out of lives and therefore lose the game and it will show you the text of
  the remaining buttons, then reset.

  made in the previous game.
